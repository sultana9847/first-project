<h2>Poem about Bangladesh</h2>
<p>"Bangladesh, My Golden Land"

    In Bengals heart where rivers weave,
    A tapestry the skies believe,
    Lies Bangladesh, with soul so wide,
    A land where dreams and sorrows bide.
    
    Emerald fields in morning light,
    Rice paddies gleam, a farmers might.
    The monsoon sings, the mango sways,
    And jute boats dance in silver haze.
    
    From Sundarbans where tigers tread,
    To hill tracks where the sun is red,
    She cradles life in every fold,
    In stories whispered, brave and bold.
    
    She bore the storm, she felt the flame,
    Yet rose again and earned her name.
    Through 71s defiant cry,
    A flag was born that touched the sky.
    
    Dhaka hums with endless pace,
    Chittagong holds the oceans grace.
    From Sylhets tea to Rajshahi's vine,
    Her people rise, her children shine.
    
    O Bangladesh, so fierce, so kind,
    With poets soul and workers mind.
    You bloom in hearts across the seas,
    A song of hope on every breeze.</p>
